title: Week 6
---

So here we are at week 6! The term sure is moving quickly, as the we've already nearly arrived at week 6. This week was partly focused on a new topic I had not yet seen - lambda functions! I thought lambda functions were pretty cool, they remind me a lot of the same types of functions I've seen in say Scala and Python, foldLeft and reduce, respectively. I'm not entirely sure what else you use lambda functions for other than to reduce the amount you have to type, since they seem to take the place of a loop. I like Wednesday's lecture where we were introduced to range iterator. It was fun working with people to draft up our own version of a range iterator, since I had not yet worked with defining behavior for notations in C++! 

Unfortunately I can't yet speak too much to what I learned on Friday, since I was in Redmond, WA that day, interviewing with Microsoft. I had to miss a quiz (which surprisingly dropped my quiz grade a fair bit), but I felt like the interview was a worthwhile experience. I have to say, already I've found OOP to be helpful for interviews!! On my interview with National Instruments, I was able to solve a problem by passing something as a reference rather than making a copy! 

So lastly, my tip of the week is to not plan on doing much the day you fly back from an interview. You'll be exhausted, and despite your best efforts, not much will get done (and you deserve a break).

title: Week 12
---

This week covered an array of topics. The first class introduced the project for the next two weeks, Life. I'm going to go ahead and begin with my tip of the week, which I feel should have been mentioned earlier, which is to not underestimate how little time two weeks really is. Given that these are partner projects, its incredibly easy for them to be sidelined in the early stages of the project in favor of taking care of other work. However, my partner and I did look at the project enough to be nearly certain of all the ways we want to implement the different functionalities of life, we just need to finish the implementation and enjoy the debugging experience.

I'd like to talk about the presentation from Wednesday by Atlassian as well. When I came into the room and saw the two presenters in their Atlassian shirts, I was super excited! I had worked with Atlassian products in previous job, and I was fairly familiar with their tools, so to see them present was really pretty neat. I hoped to learn more about where their product names came from so I'd have some interesting tidbit to tell people at work later in life, but oh well :) In any case, they discussed the details of feature implementation, which actually seemed to basically coincide with what I had seen at other companies as well. However, it was neat to see how they used their own tools, and how organized they kept the development process.
